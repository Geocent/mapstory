The past happened somewhere, and it is high time that someone show you where and when it happened, particularly as it relates to the world you live in today.  MapStory is here to empower you to achieve a superior understanding of our world, and to help you throughout your life to be a more effective and successful person.  Success, after all, is based on what you know.  But, we promise you this.  Knowing when and where it all went down is key.  Work with us, and we will help you become badass.

Too little emphasis is placed on history and geography anymore.  Our society\u2019s historical memory and knowledge of the world is anemic, at best.  And, we wonder why we are in trouble!  If we are here to do anything, we are here to empower you \u2013 the teachers.  It is time for a new generation of kids to grow up with an understanding of the world around them that is not just based on some turgid text that does little to light up their imaginations.  We want kids (of all ages) to not only have access to a rich body of spatial and temporal knowledge that can tell them about the world around them, but access to many disparate narratives (yes, MapStories) that can communicate why various dimensions of our past and present are important.  Moreover, we want you and your students to be empowered to create your own MapStories and publish them to the world.  Think of it as a new way to do a book report?!  They may be about world history, important recent events, or they may be about the past century in your own hometown.  Your local MapStory is often just as important as world historic events from some distant land.  And, it is guaranteed to make history and geography (and a dozen other academic disciplines) more meaningful to your students and their parents.

At its best, MapStory can be a common environment for inter-discplinary or trans-disciplinary exploration.  This is no simple feat.  We understand that.  Please bear with us!

MapStory seeks to let you publish this data in a way that makes it actually meaningful to the citizens and politicians that are your ultimate task masters.  Regular people want to understand how policies relate to them, where they and their families live, and how things have changed for them over their lifetimes.  Place and time are key organizing dimensions of the human condition.  And, it is about time that public agencies and policymakers communicate their data this way to the public, and the politicians they elect.

Businesses often have the best data about where they were founded, the geographies they expanded across over time, their history of mergers and acquisitions, their evolving supply chains and markets, you name it.
