       <h4>From MapStory founder Christopher Tucker</h4>
       <p>MapStory is not Wikipedia. But, like Wikipedia, we want MapStory to be a
special place where “we can all go to think, to learn, to share our knowledge
with others”. As a 501c3 non-profit, the MapStory Foundation seeks to provide
www.mapstory.org as a new dimension to the global data commons, which
empowers all of us to organize the world’s knowledge spatially and temporally
- rather than encyclopedically.
       </p>
       <p>When it comes to certain problems, I strongly believe that you can either make
money off of them, or you can solve them. But, you can’t do both. MapStory
was conceived of in order to let everyone dedicate to the global data commons
their knowledge about how the world has changed over time. For this to work,
people must be secure in their knowledge that their cultural contributions are
not subject to commercial influence.
       </p>
       <p>MapStory is a new social venture, and we are still working out the kinks. If you
are happy having a place where you can freely publish your spatio-temporal
representations of the world to a global user community, and to easily access
such data from others, perhaps you might consider contributing $10, $20, or
$50 to support the hosting and operations costs of this global data commons.
       </p>
       <p>
Thanks,
       </p>
